How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    The diff command automatically located the error that was introduced,
	obviating the need to manually scan each line.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    The file history will allow the programmer to more easily trace errors
	that were introduced.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Pro: You can complete control over when new versions are saved, allowing
	you to optimize the number of versions.
	Con: You may forget to save versions often enough.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Some system assume one files are not logically linked to one another (e.g., 
	Word documents), and the other assumes files may be related (e.g., code).

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    git log lists all the commits and git diff allows you to compare the changes
	from two different commits.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    You will have essentially backed up a working version of the code.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    All types of coding and maybe LaTex files.
